# EVNikola-Secondary-Electric-Controller-ArduinoMegaPRO-NextionDisplay-i2cNano-16ChannelRelay
With Arduino Mega Robodyn Mini and Nextion touch display creating controller for lights and other actuators in VW T3.

Still to do:
- timer interupt for blinkers / or using the blinknig relay?
- recheck the code for wipers
- emergency stop lights with activating both turning lights
- choose the propper fuses for actuators
- place the circuit box under the driver's seat
- place the battery and fusses under the co-driver's seat
- mount and assemble the pcb mega sheild (solder holders, mosfet, bridges, resistors, condensators, diodes, tube fuse ...)
- wire the switches and microswitches in Nicola (test again the functions - wipers!!!)
- dismount the top 
- unmount fuel tank
- buy hexagonal spacers M3 >22 mm lenght (metal or nylon)

What was done:
- ordered the PCB board in Svet-elektronike (44 €)
- installed the rear LED lights (the small for targa not yet) (90 €)
- bought misc. material in EVJ (240 €)
- bought 4 relays (35 €)
