# EVNikola-Secondary-Electric-Controller-ArduinoMegaPRO-NextionDisplay-i2cNano-16ChannelRelay
With Arduino Mega Robodyn Mini and Nextion touch display creating controller for lights and other actuators in VW T3.

Still to do:
- timer interupt for blinkers / or using the blinknig relay?
- recheck the code for wipers
- emergency stop lights with activating both turning lights
- choose the propper fuses for actuators #1
- place the circuit box under the driver's seat
- place the battery and fusses under the co-driver's seat
- wire the switches and microswitches in Nicola (test again the functions - wipers!!!)
- dismount the top 

What was done:
- ordered the PCB board in Svet-elektronike (44 €), aquired.
- mount and assemble the pcb mega sheild (solder holders, mosfet, bridges, resistors, condensators, diodes, tube fuse ...)
- installed the rear LED lights (the small for targa not yet) (90 €)
- bought misc. material in EVJ (240 + 45 €)
- bought 4 relays (35 €), also from ebay for wipers
- wired the back lights and placed terminal under driver seat
- placed wires from fuses compartment (passenger seat) to central circuit compartments (driver seat)
- unmount fuel tank
- bought hexagonal spacers M3 >22 mm lenght (metal or nylon) - done, but will use 16-channel relay module!!!
